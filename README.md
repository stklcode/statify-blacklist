## Description ##
A blacklist extension for the famous [Statify](https://wordpress.org/plugins/statify/) Wordpress plugin.

This plugin adds a customizable blacklist to Statify to allow blocking of referer spam or internal interactions.

### Features ##

#### Referer Blacklist ####
Add a list of domains (for simplicity only second-level, e.g. _example.com_ which blocks _everything.example.com_).

#### Target Blacklist ####
Add a list of target pages (e.g. _/test/page/_, _/?page_id=123_) that will be excluded from tracking.

#### IP Blacklist ####
Add a list of IP addresses or subnets (e.g. _192.0.2.123_, _198.51.100.0/24_, _2001:db8:a0b:12f0::/64_).

#### CleanUp Database ####
Filters can be applied to data stored in database after modifying filter rules or for one-time clean-up.

#### Compatibility ####
This plugin requires Statify to be installed. The extension has been tested with Statify up to version 1.7
The plugin is capable of handling multisite installations.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### What is blocked by default? ###
Nothing. By default, all blacklists are empty and disabled. They can and have to be filled by the blog administrator.

A default blacklist is not provided, as the plugin itself is totally neutral. If you want to filter out referer spam, 
visitors from search engines, just "false" referrers from 301 redirects or you own IP address used for testing only depends on you.

### Does the filter effect user experience? ###
No. It only prevents _Statify_ from tracking, nothing more or less.

### Does live filtering impact performance? ###
Yes, but probably not noticeable. Checking a single referer string against a (usually small) list should be negligible compared to the total loading procedure.
If this still is an issue for you, consider deactivating the filter and only run the one-time-cleanup or activate the cron job.
 
### Is any personal data collected? ###
No. The privacy policy of _Statify_ is untouched. Data is only processed, not stored or exposed to anyone.

### Are regular expression filters possible? ###
Yes, it is. Just select regular expressions (case-sensitive or insensitive) as matching method instead of exact or keyword match.

### Why is IP filtering only available as live filter? ###
As you might know, _Statify_ does not store any personal information, including IP addresses in the database.
Because of this, an IP blacklist can only be applied while processing the request and not afterwards.

### Can whole IP subnet be blocked? ###
Yes. The plugin features subnet blacklists using CIDR notation.
For example _198.51.100.0/24_ blacklists all sources from _198.51.100.1_ to _198.51.100.254_.
Same for IPv6 prefixes like _2001:db8:a0b:12f0::/64_.
